/**
 * The badge icon family: four line glyphs for the four model facts a row states,
 * plus the slash that marks an unsupported or absent one.
 *
 * WHY THIS ARTWORK IS DRAWN HERE. The host icon set
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`) ships no text-modality and no
 * image-modality glyph at all, and borrowing the two that do fit the other
 * facts would put two drawing styles in one ~170px strip. So all four are drawn
 * to the host's own rules — `fill="none"`, `currentColor`, round caps and joins,
 * one `viewBox` for the family — which is what makes the strip read as part of
 * the shell.
 *
 * THE FOUR GLYPHS, and the metaphor each one commits to:
 *
 *   text    the letterform "T": the modality itself, not a page and not a
 *           paragraph. Drawn WITHOUT a foot serif, which in a zh UI turns it
 *           into the CJK character 工.
 *   image   a framed picture: rounded frame, one horizon, one sun dot. The sun
 *           is what separates "image" from "rectangle border", so it is the one
 *           detail dropped when the badge is slashed.
 *   effort  a brain's silhouette, the two lobes meeting at a stem — the mark the
 *           rest of this product already uses for "thinking" (the chat's
 *           reasoning disclosure and the composer's own effort chip). Drawn
 *           from the same 24-unit artwork the host ships for that mark, so a
 *           reader who has seen a thinking row recognises this one; the level's
 *           *name* rides next to it as text. Earlier versions used three
 *           ascending bars, which said "how many levels" and nothing about what
 *           they were levels *of*.
 *   context a window: a rounded frame with its title bar and one line of
 *           content inside. Chosen over the width/span marks (`[—]`, `|—|`) that
 *           were tried first, because those read as a minus sign at small sizes
 *           while this one says 窗口/window outright — and it stays distinct
 *           from the image glyph, which has a horizon and a sun instead of lines.
 *
 * THE GRID. The first three glyphs are drawn on the host's 16-unit grid, which
 * is the grid the icons around them use; the brain is the host's own 24-unit
 * artwork and keeps its own `viewBox`. Both are square and both fill their box,
 * and every glyph carries an explicit `stroke-width` in ITS OWN user units so
 * the family draws one weight on screen: at the row's 14px a 1.6-unit stroke on
 * the 16 grid and a 2.4-unit stroke on the 24 grid both land on 1.4px. (The
 * brain's own 2 units would draw 1.17px — 17% lighter than its three
 * neighbours, which is visible as a thinner mark in the same strip. Inheriting
 * the host's 1px would be worse still: 0.58px across 24 units.)
 *
 * THE SLASH is the usual "not available" mark: one stroke from top-left to
 * bottom-right across the glyph, carried by the glyph itself (one path in the
 * artwork's own units) rather than painted over the cell by the stylesheet — a
 * mark drawn twice, once per mechanism, is how the two end up crossing at
 * different angles. An unsupported fact keeps its own glyph, drops the detail
 * that would turn to mush under the slash (the sun, the window's content line),
 * and switches to the quiet tone — so "unsupported" is legible without relying
 * on color alone.
