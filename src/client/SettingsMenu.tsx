/**
 * The model settings surface: the parameters of the model the seat has selected.
 *
 * ALL THREE FIELDS HERE ARE LIVE, each through the door its owner actually
 * offers:
 *
 *   - input modalities and the context window are written into the adapter's
 *     own declaration for this route (`settings/mutate` over the namespace and
 *     path `llm/listConfigurableProviders` names), which the adapter re-resolves
 *     immediately — the same fields the shipped Models settings page edits;
 *   - reasoning effort is submitted through the shared `directory.select()`, and
 *     the marked level comes back from the shared directory, so only what the
 *     Host accepted is ever shown as active. This is the one place effort can be
 *     changed: the model menu's rows only state the effort in force.
 *
 * The panel therefore shows what the Host says, not what this plugin remembers:
 * every displayed value is read from the settings snapshot, and a write that the
 * Host refuses leaves the shown value where it was and states the reason.
 *
 * A route the adapter serves straight from its installed catalog has no
 * declaration to edit; the panel opens read-only for it and says why, instead of
 * offering a control that would silently do nothing.
 *
 * The panel is a sibling popover of the model menu and the provider menu — one
 * popover at a time, never nested — and it owns and stops the keys it consumes,
 * exactly like the other two levels.
 *
 * Opening it puts focus on the PANEL, not on the capacity field: the field is the
 * only text input here, it commits on blur, and this card is anchored to the
 * composer where a summoned keypad would cover it. `Tab` then walks the controls
 * in the order they are rendered, which is the order the switches appear in.
 *
