/**
 * What the parameter panel SAYS in each state, as data.
 *
 * The panel has one job that is easy to get wrong and impossible to see in a
 * screenshot: naming, per state, which line explains why a control is inert and
 * which line states where a value comes from. Those are two different jobs and
 * they were once done by the same sentence, three times over — the notice and
 * both section hints each said "you cannot edit this" for an unaddressable
 * route, and the effort list greying itself out after the user's own click had
 * no sentence at all.
 *
 * So the selection is a pure function here, next to the panel but not inside it:
 * `scripts/test-params.mjs` bundles this module with the real dictionary and
 * asserts the exact keys each state produces, and `SettingsMenu.tsx` only
 * renders the result. A rule like "the notice is the only place an unusable
 * state is explained" is then a fact the unit gate owns, not a convention the
 * next edit has to remember.
