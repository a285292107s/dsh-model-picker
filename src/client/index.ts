 * gives the `/model` popup — that shared instance is what makes the two entries
 * one state, with no synchronization code here.

 * Shadowing, not replacing: the seat is registered at `priority: -10`, and the
 * slot registry renders the lowest priority. The shipped seat (`priority` 0)
 * keeps its registration and its `/model` contribution; deleting this plugin's
 * row restores it with no further change.
