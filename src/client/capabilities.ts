/**
 * The facts an adapter PUBLISHED about its own routes, for the routes the
 * settings document cannot address.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The panel and the row can only tell two kinds of truth: what
 * the profile declares, and what the adapter will do with no declaration. A
 * route the adapter serves straight out of its installed catalog has neither —
 * `llm/listConfigurableProviders` does not even name it, so `resolveRoute`
 * returns null and the row used to draw no modality badge and no window while
 * the panel drew BOTH modality switches as off, which is a claim about the model
 * that nothing had verified. The adapter, however, does know: it ships a
 * per-model catalog and, for the third-party adapters, publishes it over a
 * Remote of its own.
 *
 * TWO WAYS IN, IN THIS ORDER.
 *
 *   1. An adapter-owned catalog Remote ({@link CapabilitySource}), registered
 *      here by whichever deployment mounts that namespace. This is the only way
 *      to some routes at all: `dsh-opencode-go` never registers a configurable
 *      provider, so it appears in no settings directory and only its own
 *      `opencodeGoModels/read` answers.
 *   2. `llm/discoverModels`, but ONLY for a route its own adapter ships
 *      something about (`declared !== true`). A route the adapter admits it
 *      knows only from configuration makes that call reach for the ENDPOINT
 *      itself — a network request and a credential use summoned by opening the
 *      model menu, which is not a cost a picker may impose silently. Such a
 *      route therefore stays unread, and the row states no fact rather than a
 *      guessed one.
 *
 * WHAT A READ COSTS. One Remote call per ANSWERED provider per page load:
 * {@link CapabilityStore} never refetches a provider it holds an answer for,
 * and joins concurrent asks. An ask that never reached an answer — the LLM face
 * was not mounted yet, a transport failure — is released for the next open to
 * try again; that race is real because the Remote namespaces mount
 * asynchronously. There is deliberately no polling and no push subscription —
 * an adapter catalog changes when its owner refreshes it, and the next page load
 * sees that.
 *
